MicroPython IoT Hackathon, featuring the ESP8266
================================================

**Abstract:**

Due in large part to the availability of cheap, low-power, internet-connected
microcontrollers, the Internet of Things is taking off. Python developers can
get in on the excitement with MicroPython, an implementation of Python 3 that
runs on very small devices with no operating system. MicroPython provides
the standard Python REPL (read-eval-print-loop) interface, so you can
interactively develop and debug applications on these small devices.

This document provides instructions for a hackathon/class centered around
MicroPython. In the class, students will learn some basic electronics, wire
up some sensors to a low-power wireless controller board (based on the ESP8266
microcontroller), load the MicroPython firmware, and interactively write simple
applications to read from the sensors. It also discusses how to connect to
other systems via the MQTT messaging protocol and exchange ideas on larger
projects that can be built at home for low cost with beginner-level knowledge.

This was original created for use at a San Francisco Python Project Night
meetup. It is designed to be reusable for other classes as well as for
individual study.
